Q1)  Explain the difference between ArrayList and LinkedList
Ans: ArrayList use dynamic array to store the elements and linkedList use a doubly linkedList to store the elements. If we want to remove element from arrayList is
     expensive because we have to shift all the indexes after removing the element in ArrayList and in linkedList we don't need to shift the indexes of element after
     removing the element only need to change the the address in the node. ArrayList is best for storing and accessing the data whereas LinkList is best of
     manipulating the data
   
   
Q3)  Explain the difference between equals() and HashCode() Method.
Ans: Hashcode method returns the unique value to related to object and equals method check the object refereances equality of two object whether those object is same or not.
     In hashcode that hashcode value came from memory address in heap and in equals method if and only if two object are same when their memory address is same.
     When can override this method and write our logic accordingly in equals method and we can't override the hashcode method to do our logic.
