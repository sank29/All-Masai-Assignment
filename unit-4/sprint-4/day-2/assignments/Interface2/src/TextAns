Q1)  Explain about the Marker interface?
Ans: An interface does not contain methods, fields is know as marker interface. Empty interface is also know as interface. 
     Serialization and Cloneable is example of Marker interface.
     
     example:
     
     public interface Sanket{
     
     
     
     
     }
     
     Above interface is know as Marker interface.
     
     
Q2)  Why multiple Inheritance is not supported in Java at the class Level?
Ans: In java multiple inheritace is not supported because of ambiguity problem in java.

     Example: class sanket{ 
        public void displayName(){
         System.out.println("Sanket");
        }
     }
     
     class akash{
     public void displayName(){
     System.out.println("Akash");
     }
     }
     
     
     class Main extends sanket,akash{
     
     public static void main(String[] args){
         Main obj = new Main();
         
         obj.displayName() // ambiguity error
     }
     
     }
