Q2)  Explain about Hashcode and Equals Method.
Ans: Hashcode method returns the unique value to related to object and equals method check the object refereances equality of two object whether those object is same or not.
     In hashcode that hashcode value came from memory address in heap and in equals method if and only if two object are same when their memory address is same.
     When can override this method and write our logic accordingly in equals method and we can't override the hashcode method to do our logic.
