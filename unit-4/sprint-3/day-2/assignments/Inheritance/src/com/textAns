Q4)   Explain the difference between overloading and overriding methods with an example?
Ans : In overloading method name is same but method parameter is difference. In overriding we are overriding the 
      method in other class and we are setting the method body as we wish. Overloading occurs in same class and 
      overriding occurs in in two classes with inheritance relationships. For method overloading inheritance is may or
      may be required but in method overriding inheritance is required.
