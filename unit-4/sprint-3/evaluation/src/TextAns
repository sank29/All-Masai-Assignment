Question 2: Briefly explain the difference between Early and Late Binding with examples.

Ans :  Early binding is decided on compile time and late binding is decided on run-time.
       Real object is not use of early binding and real object is use for late binding.
       Method overloading is example of early binding and method overriding is example 
       of late binding.
       
Question 5:
a) Does the below code compile successfully? If not, why?
       
       
interface A{
int i = 111;
}
class B implements A{
void methodB(){
i = 222;
}
}
       
       
Ans:  It will not give compile error, because interface A should not override the int it should override the method.
