Q1)  Explain Type casting and its types with examples?
Ans: The process of converting one data type to another is called type casting
     There are two type of casting:
     Implicit type casting 
     Explicit type casting

     In Implicit type casting, If we convert data from lower data type to higher data
     type then this casting is called implicit type casting.
     Example:-
     byte num = 10;
     int result = num;
     System.out.println(result);

     In Explicit type casting, If we convert data from higher 
     data type to lower data type then this casting is called explicit type casting.
     Example:-
     Int result = 10;
     byte num = (byte)result;
     From the above example we are trying to save our data from int 
     to byte thatâ€™s why error will come therefore we have to explicitly write (byte) 
     in front of the result to tell the compiler first to convert this result into byte 
     the save into byte data type.

     
Q3)  Explain the difference between local and instance variables?	
Ans: Instance variables are declared within the class but 
     outside the method and local variables are declared within the 
     method and its scope is generally limited to the method. Instance variables access 
     throughout the class and local variables we can access only in method. Instance variables 
     will get default value if value is not assigned by the user but in local variables we have 
     to assign value before using it.

     Example of Instance:
     class Person{
     int age = 20; // Instance variable 
     }


     Example of local variables:

     class Person{
     public static void calculateAge(){
     int age = 23; // local variable 
     System.out.println(2022 - age)

     }
     }

     Explain : From above example int age is local variable
