Day 1 Assignment JA111

Q1)  Write the difference between JRE, JDK and JVM?
Ans: JDK (Java Development Software) is software development
     environment used to development java applications.
     In JDK there is JRE and a development tool (compiler, debugger).
     JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment.
     In JRE there are JVM (Java Virtual Machine) and predefined library classes.
     If we want to run only java application then we need only JRE and no need to download
     development tool, we can download JRE separately but we can’t download development tool
     separately. What will happen in JRE first our .java file goes to java compiler
     the compiler compiles the file if there is no error then .class file will
     generate and that .class file goes to JVM and then our file will execute. 

Q2)  Write the difference between JSE, JEE and JME?
Ans: JSE (Java Standard Edition) is used for developing applications/desktop applications.
     JEE (Java Enterprise Edition) is used to develop big enterprise web applications.
     JME (Java Micro Edition) is used for applications run on mobile, smart watches etc.

Q3)  How does java achieve platform independency?
Ans: The meaning of java achieves platform independency meaning
     java compiled code can run on all operating systems. 

Q4)  What are features of Java and explain them?
Ans: Java is platform independent because if we can run java compiled code on any operating system.
     Java is simple to learn, Java is designed in such a way that we can
     learn this language very quickly. With java we can write code securely
     without viruses, we can’t change java byte code, robust, multithreading,
     high performance, dynamic are all features of java.
