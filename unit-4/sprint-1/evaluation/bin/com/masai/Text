Q1)  Explain why Java is platform independent ?

Ans: Java is platform independent because all java code compiled in byte code and this byte code or this
     .class file we can run on any platform that's why java is platform independent.

     .Class file or byte code makes java platform independent. When we compiled the code then .class 
     file generated and this file can executable on all platform.




Q3) Change this block of code according to the given instruction and explain the output?

    public class Demo {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
         int a = 64;
         int b = 70;
         byte c = (byte)a+b;//typecast (a+b) to byte
         System.out.println(c){
    }
   }

Ans: If when what to type cast the int value into byte then we need to cast explicitly (byte)
     into the code then int value will cast into byte and then we can store that value into byte c
     variable

     byte c = (byte)a+b need in code to store the value in byte c.
