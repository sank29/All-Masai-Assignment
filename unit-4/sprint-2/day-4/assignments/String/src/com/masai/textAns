Q1)  Is there any difference between creating a string with and without a new operator?  
     Explain with an example.

Ans: Yes there is hug difference between creating a string with and without a new operator, because if we create new
     string without giving the new operator then one object will create in scp area if we again created the new string
     without the new operator with same value string then it will not create the new string and the same object will 
     point to that newly created string. If we created the new string with help of new keyword then every time we create
     the string then new keyword will reserve some space in heap area and it will create new object there.
