Q3)  How many types of relationships exist among tables in the Database? Explain with some examples, and also mention how to establish
     these relationships among tables with examples.

Ans: There are there type of relationships exist among the tables

     1. One to one relationship
     2. one to many relationship
     3. Many to Many relationship
     
     1. One to one relationship:
     examples are Person to passport relationship, person to name etc
     
     if we create person table and set person id to primary key and we create person details table in this table if we set foreign key person id to 
     reference to person id then the relationship is called as one to one relationship.
     
     2. One to many relationship
     
     examples are person to house, person to child, teacher to student
     
     3. Many to many relationship
     
     examples are Movie to actors, Book to author this are many to many relationship.
