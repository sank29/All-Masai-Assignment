     at least 5, and the reason when those exception class object is generated in our application.

Ans: Exception handling is very important in java if we want to terminate our problem normally if there is a exception in runtime therefore
     exception handling is required in java. Throwable class is extended by Error class and exception class in java this is the hierarchy
     of exception. There are lots of predefined exception classes some of them are ArithmaticException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundExcepion,
     NullPointerException, RuntimeException, ClassNotFoundException etc.
     
     
     ArithmaticException: This exception occurs when there we are dividing the number with zero. 
     
     ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException: This exception ouccurs when we are accessing the index is not present in ArrayList then this 
                                    exception will create by jvm.

     NullPonterException: This exception occurs when we are accessing the data from null.
     
     RuntimeException: This exception occurs in runtime.
     
     ClassNotFoundException: When we are requesting a class but that class is not existing in our package then this exception will come.
