Question 1: Explain difference between PriorityQueue() and LinkedList().
Ans: PriorityQueue is special type of queue to store the data in this queue we can give the priority of our store the data and we can
     access that data accordingly and in linkedList we can add our data we can access that data accordingly. Priority queue is very useful
     if we want our data in priority manner and linkedList is useful if our most of the operation is deleting and adding in the linkedList.
     

Question 4: Explain Generics in Java and Its Importance with example  
Ans:   From generics in java we can make our collection type Type-safety. Type safety means we can store only one type data in our 
       collection and we can't add more than one type of data in collection, if we add so then our compiler will throw the error and 
       we can't compile our code. If we use generics then we don't need to type cast our object and we can safely use that collection
       for our work. 
       
       Example:
       
       class Main{
         public static void main(String[] args){
             ArrayList<String> arrString = new ArrayList<>();
             
             arrString.add("Sanket");
             arrString.add("Akash");
             arrString.add(10); // compile time error
         }
       }
       
       In this above example we are assigning the type in diamond bracket and we are assigning the type String then we can't assign the
       other that String type in ArrayList collection.
